## Development

* Navigate to the root of the project

* That's it!

## Directory structure

* `src/`
    * `src/main.ts` - the main file that boots up the game.
    * `src/static/` - all of your static assets, such as 3D models, CSS, audio, ...
    * `src/Game/` - all of your game logic belongs here.
    * `src/Framework/` - all of your generic engine stuff will belong here. Think of it as a collection of classes, helpers, managers, ... that you'll be able to reuse in your next game.
